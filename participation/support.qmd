### Scholarships

Travel support grants are available to invitees from low-SES backgrounds (such as middle-lower income countries) and early-career forecasters (ECFs). The value of the scholarship ranges from US\$500 - US\$1,000, and they are available on a limited basis.

Additional information about these grants can be found in your invitation email.

These grants are made available with thanks to the generous support of our [event sponsors](/about/sponsors).
